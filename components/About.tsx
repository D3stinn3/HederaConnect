        About Us
      </h1>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        In the digital age, valuable knowledge is scattered across multiple social media platforms,
        making it difficult for users to access comprehensive and well-organized information. Our
        platform, built on <strong>Hedera</strong>, is designed to solve this by aggregating
        educational content and articles from various social media sites into one seamless hub.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">Our Mission</h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        Our mission is to empower the Hedera community by simplifying access to educational content,
        enhancing collaboration, and ensuring that valuable insights are not lost in the noise of
        social media.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">Why Hedera?</h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        We leverage <strong>Hedera’s decentralized</strong> and efficient architecture to provide a
        transparent, secure, and tamper-proof content aggregation system. This ensures credibility
        and authenticity while maintaining the decentralized ethos of blockchain technology.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-gray-100">What’s Next?</h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
        As we continue developing the platform, we plan to introduce reward mechanisms for content
        creators, ensuring that those who contribute valuable insights are recognized and
        incentivized.
