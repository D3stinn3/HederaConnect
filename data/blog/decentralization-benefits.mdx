# Why Decentralization Matters in Blockchain

Decentralization ensures **trust, security, and censorship resistance** in blockchain networks.

## Benefits of Decentralization:

- **Security**: Reduces single points of failure.
- **Transparency**: Open ledger for all participants.
- **Censorship Resistance**: No single entity controls transactions.
- **Scalability**: Distributed networks can grow efficiently.

Hedera follows a **governing council model**, ensuring **decentralized yet highly efficient** network operations.
