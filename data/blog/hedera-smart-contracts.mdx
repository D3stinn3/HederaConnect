# Building Smart Contracts on Hedera

Hedera supports **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible** smart contracts, allowing developers to deploy Solidity-based contracts seamlessly.

## Key Benefits

- **Fast Execution**: Hedera processes contracts efficiently.
- **Low Costs**: Smart contract fees are lower than Ethereum.
- **Scalability**: Hedera handles a high volume of contract interactions.
- **Security**: The network is resistant to attacks.

Developers can use Hedera's **Smart Contract Service (HSCS)** to build powerful decentralized applications (DApps) with **predictable fees and high performance**.
