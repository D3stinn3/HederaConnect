# Introduction to Hedera Hashgraph

Hedera Hashgraph is a distributed ledger technology that provides a fast, secure, and fair way to achieve consensus. Unlike traditional blockchains, it uses the **gossip protocol** and **virtual voting** for faster transaction processing.

## Key Features

- **High throughput**: Supports thousands of transactions per second.
- **Fair ordering**: Uses timestamping instead of miner prioritization.
- **Low fees**: Predictable and cost-efficient transactions.
- **Enterprise-grade security**: Asynchronous Byzantine Fault Tolerance (aBFT).

Hedera is a powerful alternative to blockchain for businesses and developers looking for scalability and security.
