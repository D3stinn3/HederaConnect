# How Hedera Differs from Traditional Blockchains

Unlike **blockchains**, which use proof-of-work or proof-of-stake, Hedera uses the **Hashgraph consensus algorithm**.

## Key Differences:

| Feature   | Blockchain     | Hedera Hashgraph        |
| --------- | -------------- | ----------------------- |
| Consensus | Mining/Staking | Gossip & Virtual Voting |
| Speed     | Slower         | Up to 10,000 TPS        |
| Fees      | High           | Low                     |
| Security  | Good           | aBFT-secure             |

Hedera offers **higher performance, security, and efficiency** compared to traditional blockchain networks.
